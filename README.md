This is a personal project — a fully interactive birthday card I created for my father. It’s built using TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and features a custom bone animation using DragonBones.

Features:
- 🎨 Responsive design for desktop and mobile (note: some animations may lag slightly on lower-end devices)
- 💫 Animated stars, text, and elements triggered by interaction
- 🦴 DragonBones skeletal animation integration

🛠 Tech Stack:
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- DragonBones (for animation)
- Canvas + custom animations

📝 Note
This project was made as a surprise and a learning journey — performance may vary slightly across devices due to animation complexity.
