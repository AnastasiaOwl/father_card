This is a personal project — a fully interactive birthday card I created for my father. It’s built using TypeScript, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and features a custom bone animation using DragonBones.

Features:
🎨 Responsive design for desktop and mobile
💫 Animated stars, text, and elements triggered by interaction
🦴 DragonBones skeletal animation integration
📱 Optimized for mobile (note: some animations may lag slightly on lower-end devices)

🛠 Tech Stack:
Next.js
TypeScript
Tailwind CSS
DragonBones (for animation)
Canvas + custom animations

📝 Note
This project was made as a surprise and a learning journey — performance may vary slightly across devices due to animation complexity.
